 “Did murmur spread in pre-Proto-Indo-European?” is now published in *Indogermanische Forschungen*.<!--more--> The paper (co-written with Charles Barrack and [Richard Wright](http://depts.washington.edu/phonlab/people/wright.htm)) discusses the unusual distribution of stop consonant phonations in reconstructions of Proto-Indo-European, and a possible explanation for why it might genuinely have been so. The published version is [here](http://dx.doi.org/10.1515/if-2014-0009) and the pre-publication manuscript is [here](/pubs/BarrackEtAl2014_PIEmurmur.pdf).
