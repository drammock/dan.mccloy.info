The paper “Auditory attention strategy depends on target linguistic properties and spatial configuration” has been accepted for publication in *The Journal of the Acoustical Society of America*.<!--more--> The experiments discussed in the paper involve listening to four spatially distinct word streams with interdigitated word onset times, and performing an oddball detection task while selectively attending to one or two of the streams and ignoring the others. Comparisons are made between trials with semantic vs. phonetic definition of oddballs, and variation in the number of distinct words per stream. Results are analyzed using mixed effects probit regression. You can read the pre-publication manuscript [here](/pubs/McCloyLee2015_DividedAttentionSemanticPhonetic.pdf).
