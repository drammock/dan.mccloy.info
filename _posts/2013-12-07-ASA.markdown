Had a great time at the Acoustical Society meeting in San Francisco this week, and ended the trip with a visit to [CCRMA][ccrma] at Stanford and dinner with Malcolm Slaney. <more /> I presented my poster [“Effects of auditory spatial attention in a semantic classification task”][div] despite having completely lost my voice by the time the friday poster session rolled around.
