At the [171st Meeting of the Acoustical Society of America](http://acousticalsociety.org/content/spring-2016-meeting) in Salt Lake City, I will be hosting a special session on “Quantitative Methodology in Physiological and Psychophysical Data Analysis”<!--more--> (along with co-organizers [Hari Bharadwaj](http://www.haribharadwaj.com/) and [Ross Maddox](http://faculty.washington.edu/rkmaddox/)). The session is **3aPP** and runs 07:55-11:45, Wednesday 25 May 2016. We have talks planned on signal detection theory, response time modeling, pupillometry, individual differences analysis, non-parametric approaches to electrophysiological data, modern regression approaches to behavioral data in psychophysics, and monte carlo approaches to determining sensory thresholds. You should come!
