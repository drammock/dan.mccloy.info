For the next 11 months I will be living in Hohhot, Inner Mongolia, China. <more /> My wife has received a Fulbright research fellowship to fund her dissertation data collection, so I will be accompanying her in the field and continuing my own research remotely, with one or two brief trips back stateside to do some data collection. In the meantime, Iâ€™ll be writing up past research results, developing new experiment code, and immersing myself in the local culture. Internet access in Hohhot seems to be fairly stable at present, but if that changes I may not be as responsive as usual.
