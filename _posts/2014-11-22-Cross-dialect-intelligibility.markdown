“Talker versus dialect effects on speech intelligibility: A symmetrical study” is now in press in *Language and Speech*.<!--more--> The paper (co-written with [Richard Wright](http://depts.washington.edu/phonlab/people/wright.htm) and [Pam Souza](http://www.communication.northwestern.edu/faculty/PamelaSouza)) uses mixed-effects regression to model the impact of talker-specific variation vs. dialect-based variation on speech intelligibility, while controlling for a variety of acoustic features of the talkers’ speech that are known to impact intelligibility. The published version is [here](http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0023830914559234) and the final pre-publication manuscript is [here](/pubs/McCloyEtAl_CrossDialectIntelligibility.pdf).
