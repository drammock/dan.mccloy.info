# Overview
My research interests include auditory neuroscience, speech perception, acoustic phonetics, and phonetic and phonological typology. More specifically, I work on auditory attention in multitalker environments, individual differences in intelligibility, and distinctive feature theory.

# Current position
Postdoctoral fellow, [Laboratory for Auditory Brain Science & Neuroengineering](http://depts.washington.edu/labsn/) (PI: [Adrian KC Lee](http://faculty.washington.edu/akclee/)), part of the [Institute for Learning & Brain Sciences](http://ilabs.washington.edu/) at the University of Washington. I’m working on experiments that test the interaction between auditory attention and speech processing, by manipulating linguistic features of speech stimuli in auditory attention tasks.
