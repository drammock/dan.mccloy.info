# Overview
I am a scientist trained in acoustic phonetics, speech perception, and auditory neuroscience. I research auditory attention and speech processing in multitalker environments, individual differences in speech intelligibility, and the relationship between speech perception and distinctive feature theory.

# Current position
Postdoctoral research associate, [Laboratory for Auditory Brain Science & Neuroengineering](http://depts.washington.edu/labsn/) (_[LABS]^N^_, PI: [Adrian KC Lee](http://faculty.washington.edu/akclee/)), part of the [Institute for Learning & Brain Sciences](http://ilabs.washington.edu/) at the University of Washington. Current research projects:

- Investigating the influence of linguistic structure on auditory selective and divided attention
- Measuring effort-related pupillary response in auditory attention tasks
- Predicting non-native phone (mis)perception using EEG
