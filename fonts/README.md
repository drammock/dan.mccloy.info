### drammock
This is a small custom font made with [Fontello](http://fontello.com/). Some of the icons are from [Font Awesome](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and others (ORCiD, NCBI, Google Scholar, and the brain) are original creations in the sense that I created the SVG files (often by tracing raster versions of the logos) that were then uploaded to Fontello to generate the webfont.
