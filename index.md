<p class="message">
I am a scientist trained in acoustic phonetics, speech perception, and auditory neuroscience.
</p>

Currently I work as a postdoctoral researcher in the [Laboratory for Auditory Brain Science & Neuroengineering][labsn], part of the [Institute for Learning & Brain Sciences][ilabs] at the University of Washington. I got my PhD from the [UW Department of Linguistics][ling] under [Richard Wright][raw] as a member of the [phonetics lab][phonlab].  Before starting my graduate studies I was a graphic designer for four years<!--, and during graduate school I maintained a part-time freelance design company called [Boomslang Design][bsd]-->.  I also spent some time as Vice President of Northwest Tree Alliance, a start-up educational non-profit focused on sustainable urban ecologies.  Before that, I did my undergraduate work in Neurobiology and Philosophy, also at UW Seattle.

## About this website

This site is built with [jekyll][jekyll] from [markdown][md] source using a modified version of the [lanyon][lanyon] theme. Text is set in [Linux Libertine][lib] and [M+][mplus] using [webfonts][woff]. Most of the navigation icons come from [Font-Awesome][fa] and [AcademIcons][ai], with a few homemade ones mixed in via [Fontello][fo]. [Jekyll scholar][jeksch], [pandoc][pandoc], and [XeLaTeX][xetex] work together to generate the [HTML][cvhtml] and [PDF][cvpdf] versions of the CV, with custom [CSL][csl] and [BST][bst] files to style the bibliographic information and some python scripts to handle inconsistencies that crop up along the way. Perhaps someday Iâ€™ll get [jekyll-orcid][jeko] working for me and then the CV will just update itself, but in the meantime I try to keep it reasonably current.
