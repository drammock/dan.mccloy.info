## Overview
I am a scientist trained in acoustic phonetics, speech perception, and auditory neuroscience, and a developer of open-source scientific software. My interest broadly centers on the perception and representation of speech sounds. I am a certified [Software Carpentry](https://software-carpentry.org/team/) instructor.

**Current position:** Research Scientist at the University of Washington’s [Institute for Learning & Brain Sciences](https://ilabs.washington.edu/), where I analyze infant and adult magnetoencephalography (MEG) data, and contribute to the development of [MNE-Python](https://mne.tools/dev/index.html) neuroscience analysis software.

Structured bibliographic information for my research products is available in [this BibTeX file](../bib/McCloy_CV.bib).
